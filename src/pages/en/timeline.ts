        As a working student at Pxio, I was fully involved in the software development process of the Pxio Desktop and Web applications. After completing my bachelor's degree, I gained my first hands-on experience in agile software development with Scrum at Pxio and built a solid knowledge of TypeScript, React, Redux, and Electron.

        Over time, as my skills evolved, so did my responsibilities. In addition to the apps, I was responsible for the underlying UI components and took over the organization and presentation of the results in Sprint Reviews in the Scrum process.

        In my master's program, I chose to focus on Computer Science in the field of human-technology interaction. Theoretical content is often subsequently implemented in practical projects. 

        I also learn about new areas, such as deep learning, virtual reality or psychological aspects of software development.

        Besides my studies, I had a part-time job as a graphic designer for a coffee liqueur manufacturer in my hometown. 
        
        I mainly created print media or graphics for social media channels and promotional materials. The time helped me a lot to get a feeling before layouts and to develop an eye for a good and balanced design.
        
        Primarily, I became familiar and used the programs of the Adobe suite, especially Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.

          During my bachelor's degree I learned the basics of computer science and mathematics, programming, algorithms and data structures and much more. Due to the focus on media, topics of HCI and applied cognitive science were also present again and again.
  
          In my bachelor thesis I worked on the integration of a personalized development environment and the creation of web-based UI components into a driving simulation framework, which was supported by a research project at the university.
